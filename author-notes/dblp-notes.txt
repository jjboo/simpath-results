In an effort to reproduce and revalidate our own results in the original SimPath paper [1], we realized
that a correction should be made in a result regarding LDAG.

More specifically, LDAG finishes in approximately 23 minutes on the DBLP dataset, while the original paper
stated the corresponding running time is 35 minutes.  It is likely due to the fact that when the paper
was being prepared, the LDAG experiment on DBLP was not the only active process (except for OS required ones)
in our server, and hence it got slowed down by other processes.

To correct the record, now it stands that SimPath, on this particular dataset, is approximately 50% faster
than LDAG, instead of 67%.
